                You can play with people who has an Odoo account in your

                Odoo account is also implemented.
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mb32">
                So add as many players as people are going to play the sweepstake,

                If you create a player without filling in the user field,
                only the game administrators will be able to introduce his/her
                bets in the database, since this kind of player will not be
                able to connect to Odoo with his/her own account. Otherwise,
                if you fill in the user field, the player will have an Odoo
                account associated, and he/she will be able to bet by
                himself/herself. Just check that his/her Odoo user has at
                least sweepstake player rights in the Odoo user settings.

                cannot see the bets made by the rest of the players until
                the match is set as finished. This way, he/she cannot defend
                his/her position in the ranking copying the bets of other
                players who can overtake him/her in the ranking if they

                A manager can bet whenever he wants and modify other players
                bets. So the manager must be a person in whom everyone trust,

                Add a bet to try to guess the score of a match. When you guess
                that, you win by default 25 points which allows you to improve
                your position in the players ranking. If you do not guess the
                score but you guess which team win or if both teams reach a
                draw, you win by default 8 points. Otherwise, you do not win any
                point.

                If you have player rights, you are not allowed to create
                or modify a bet of a match which has already started. So

                Be careful with the date of the match you are creating. If

                    not any relation which modifies the rest of the data out of
                    the sweepstake, it is easily removable.
